# Internsetu
InternSetu is a full-stack internship management platform with AI Implementation that connects students and companies.  It supports secure authentication, role-based access, resume upload, and skill-based internship matching.  The project focuses on real-world backend architecture, API security, and system design, rather than production-level performance optimization.
